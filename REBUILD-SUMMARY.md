   - Added breakpoint system for responsive design
   - Created reusable UI components

5. ✅ **Enhanced Routing System**
   - Implemented route configuration with code splitting
   - Added route-level error boundaries
   - Created protected route component for authenticated pages
   - Added suspense for route-level lazy loading

6. ✅ **Performance Optimizations**
   - Added code splitting for routes and features
   - Implemented vendor bundle splitting
   - Added bundle size analyzer

### Phase 2: Feature Implementation

1. ✅ **Subscription Management**
   - Implemented subscription service for API interactions

   - Created notification badge component

3. ✅ **UI Components**
   - Implemented form components with validation
   - Created data display components
   - Added navigation components
   - Built feedback components (alerts, toasts)
   - Implemented pagination component

### Project-Wide Improvements

1. ✅ **Development Experience**
   - Updated build configurations
   - Enhanced TypeScript settings
   - Added path aliases for easier imports
   - Updated documentation

2. ✅ **Updated Configurations**
   - Enhanced Vite configuration for better performance
   - Updated TypeScript configuration for stricter typing
   - Added bundle analysis tools

3. ✅ **Documentation**
   - Updated README with new architecture details
   - Added architecture documentation
   - Improved troubleshooting guidelines

## Feature-Based Organization

The frontend has been reorganized into feature modules:

```
src/
├── api/               # API client layer
├── design-system/     # Design system tokens and theme
└── features/          # Feature modules
    ├── auth/          # Authentication
    ├── common/        # Shared components
    ├── dashboard/     # Dashboard
    ├── notifications/ # Notifications
    ├── settings/      # User settings
    ├── subscriptions/ # Subscription management
    └── templates/     # Template management
```

Each feature module contains:
- Components specific to the feature
- Feature-specific hooks
- Feature-specific services
- Pages and views
- Feature-specific utilities

## Key Technical Improvements

1. **API Client Enhancements**
   - Centralized request handling with Axios
   - Automatic token refresh
   - Request/response interceptors
   - Standardized error handling
   - Custom React Query hooks for data fetching

2. **Authentication Improvements**
   - Secure token storage
   - JWT token parsing and validation
   - Session expiration handling
   - Enhanced error recovery

3. **Subscription Management**
   - Type-safe API services
   - React Query for efficient data loading and caching
   - Optimistic updates for better UX
   - Comprehensive filtering and sorting
   - Responsive UI components

4. **Notification System**
   - Real-time notification updates
   - Optimized notification polling
   - Filterable notification list
   - Badge component with unread count
   - Mark as read/delete functionality

5. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Lazy loading of routes
   - Code splitting by feature
   - Vendor bundle splitting
   - Optimized build process

6. **Developer Experience**
   - Enhanced TypeScript configuration
   - Path aliases for cleaner imports
   - Bundle analysis tools
   - Improved error handling and debugging

## Next Steps

While significant progress has been made, several items from the rebuild plan remain to be implemented:

1. **Dashboard Implementation**
   - Create dashboard components
   - Implement analytics widgets
   - Add dashboard customization

2. **Testing Suite**
   - Set up unit testing with React Testing Library
   - Add component tests
   - Implement integration tests

3. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Add ARIA attributes to all components
   - Implement keyboard navigation
   - Enhance focus management

4. **User Settings**
   - Implement user profile management
   - Add email preferences settings
   - Create theme settings

## Conclusion

The frontend rebuild has successfully implemented a feature-based architecture, enhanced API client, improved authentication system, a standardized design system, and key features like subscription management and notifications. The new structure improves code organization, maintainability, and scalability while providing a better user experience.
